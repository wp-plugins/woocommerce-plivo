WooCommerce Plivo Plugin
========================
This Plivo plugin for WordPress WooCommerce enables the use of the popular platform for building voice and SMS enabled applications, [Plivo](http://www.plivo.com). We aim to integrate most of the features the Plivo API has to offer, but for now, we'll stick to implementing SMS order notifications.


Current features:
* Auto send status updates
* Send a test SMS
* Edit status SMS notifications
* Send an SMS from the order page

Requirements
------------
To make use of the Plivo API, this plugin requires php-openssl, php-curl, [pear package HTTP_Request2](https://github.com/pear/HTTP_Request2) to be installed.

Installation
------------
Simply download the plugin from the WordPress plugin repository, or download the current working version from Github.

About the authors & support
---------------------------
This plugin is written by the brave and handsome coders of [SiteOptimo](http://www.siteoptimo.com).
Consider this plugin a good written and functioning beta. We made it freely available for the WordPress and WooCommerce community. We might build more custom work in the future.
